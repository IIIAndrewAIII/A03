How to use Git and Github:
1) Install Git as a Local Program
Definitions:

GIT: This is a version control system that is used to keep track of changes in source code by taking snapshots of committed code, and keeping track of these snapshots over time.

GITHUB: This is a website that uses cloud based storage to help developers manage their code using GIT

Repository: This is a feature of GITHUB that contains your projects files and the history of all changes made to those projects files.

Clone: This allows your to download an entire GIT repository onto your local machine

Commit: This is when a revision to a file is made in the repository, the commit also records who made the commit and when they made the commit. It is also reccommended that the person making a commit leaves a short description of the changes

Push: A push takes a commit made locally and sends it to the remote repository(usually GITHUB)

Pull: Pull allows you to get a edited file from the local machine of someone else using the repository and add those changes to your local repository.

Branch: A branch is like a "copy" of a repository. It allows you to make changes to the branch with the safety net of not actually affecting the live branch or the "master branch" until the branch is merged with the master branch

Merge: This command takes changes from 1 branch and applies to another branch. This is often done using a pull request

Merge Conflict: This occurs when people make different changes to the same line of the same file. All merge conflict must be fixed in order to merge a pull request

Fetch: This command gets the most recent changes of the online repository but it doesnt merge them with your local repository, it allow you to compare it to the code on your local repository 

Remote: This is something that can be hosted on a server, for example GITHUB hosts your code online on their server
